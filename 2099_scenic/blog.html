                                        <p>The first ramen place I went to was Ramen Nagi. Before quarantine I
                                             would always eat at this place weekly. This is an all time classic for
                                             me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>I ordered the Butao King, which is their original flavor, and my
                                             favorite (yes I'm a basic). It is made up of: Chashu (shoulder), Green
                                             Onions, Fire
                                             Sauce, Kikurage, which is a type of mushroom, hard noodles, and their rich
                                             broth. Keep in mind that these ingredients I listed are completely
                                             customizable. For example, you can change the Green Onions to be Green
                                             Cabbages,
                                             noodles can either be extra hard, normal, soft, or extra soft, the
                                             level
                                             of spiciness, and so much more. This is what I love about Ramen Nagi, the
                                             customization of your preferred ramen, and why it is my go to ramen place.

                                        <p>Before I head to my next ramen shop, I'd like to slow down and eat some light
                                             snacks.
                                             I went to de original Jamaican Pattie Shop. They sell these beef and tuna
                                             patties
                                             in a soft shell case sort of like the shell for empanadas. I went for
                                             their Cheesy
                                             Beef which is their original flavor, but with some much needed cheese. What
                                             I love most
                                             about their patties is the shell. It has the right amount of crunch that
                                             compliments
                                             the savory filling inside very well.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>For my dessert/drink, I went to a healthier option which is
                                             Jamba Juice (believe me, I'm
                                             surpised
                                             too). I ordered their Protein Berry Workout with Whey Protein. It is
                                             made up of Strawberries, Banana, Soy Milk, and Whey Protein. This was also
                                             a go
                                             to drink
                                             for me back when everything was normal. I would order this frequently after
                                             going to the gym.

                                        <p>The Last place I went to for my food trip was Mendokoro Ramenba. If you can't
                                             already tell, I love Ramen. If there is a chance to eat ramen twice in one
                                             day,
                                             I would do it in a heartbeat.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                             Anyways, this place is much more hyped
                                             than Ramen Nagi mainly because of the hour long queue one has to endure
                                             before they get into the ramen bar. But trust
                                             me,
                                             it is always worth the wait. I ordered their Shoyu ramen which is a soy
                                             based broth. This is
                                             slightly more expensive
                                             than the first place I went to, but every drop of penny is worth it. The
                                             differences of this ramen place
                                             to the first one is that their ramen is significantly more richer. Also,
                                             their pork is charred,
                                             compared to the other one which is just broiled. As much as I loved this
                                             ramen, I
                                             can only eat here
                                             twice or thrice a month because if I ate here regularly I'm pretty sure I
                                             would die in a month.

                                             pre-quarantine especially since
                                             I'm at home 24/7 since March 2020. In the future, once the pandemic is
                                             over, or at least the number of people who are covid positive dramatically
                                             decrease, I would defenitely do this again, and review more Ramen places
                                             with friends, but only when my wallet
                                             is full again.
